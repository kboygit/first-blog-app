                      Schedule would be half in the morning in c and c++ for preparation for school in the upcoming spring semester.Yep I am going to school again
                      in Computer Science<em>(I am not smart btw)</em>.Will continue the day on the exercises , "ruby the hard way" and exercism.Then just browse through different resources to enhance knowledge related to "Internet of things/IoT"
                      and so on.Check out the best reference for c++ <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/">ðŸ‘‰ here ðŸ‘ˆ</a>.This time I will be using much more on VS code, since I am not familiar with this editor,more comfortable with atom even atom
                      boots up really slow.

                    Learning goal for this day is to to really learn deeply on applying test and integrate javascript on a rails application.But I still have a long way
                    to go for my journey from being novice to advance then eventually to be something really good at.It takes time my friend, nothing really is achievable
                    in a short period of time: unless your a prodigy with extraordinary talent from the day you were born.
